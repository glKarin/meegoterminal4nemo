This is a port of QTermWidget to Qt Graphics View Framework and MeeGo Touch.

This project consists of:

1) QGraphicsTermWidget in the lib directory, which is a port of QTermWidget
from QWidget to Qt Graphics View Framework.

2) MeeGo Touch application, meego-terminal, that uses QGraphicsTermWidget.

1 and 2 are separated so that 1 could easily be used with any other framework
than MeeGo Touch. Thus, 2 has all the MeeGo Touch specific code and 1 has plain
Qt && Qt Graphics View code.

The QGraphicsTermWidget code is based on the latest cvs checkout of QTermWidget
from: http://qtermwidget.sourceforge.net/
Last sync done on 1.1.2011.

Big thanks to everyone who has worked on Konsole and QTermWidget. Without your
effort this project would not have been possible.
